# AOJ RSVP

This script was meant to auto RSVP me to the classes 24hrs prior.

- Node (Puppeteer)
- Google Cloud Functions
- Google Cloud scheduler

## A bit of context
The CA Gov is allowing businesses to slowly go back to normal (due to COVIDE-19) which allowed [AOJ](https://artofjiujitsu.com/) classes /
slowly going back to normal but with some requirements. /
One of these requirements is to RSVP 24hrs prior to the class because we have limited number of students allowed in the mats

That being said, the day AOJ communicated this requirements to students I decided to write this script to automatically RSVP myself to daily classes /
but a day after communicating this requirement, AOJ removed due to some students having problems to RSVP.

So for that reason I decided not to finish the last part.
